# Supervised Machine Learning - Predicting Credit Risk

I will be building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not. 

## Background

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.

I used this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. I compared the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Instructions

### Retrieve the data

In the `Generator` folder in `Resources`, there is a [GenerateData.ipynb](/Resources/Generator/GenerateData.ipynb) notebook that will download data from LendingClub and output two CSVs: 

* `2019loans.csv`
* `2020Q1loans.csv`

I used an entire year's worth of data (2019) to predict the credit risk of loans from the first quarter of the next year (2020).

Note: these two CSVs have been undersampled to give an even number of high risk and low risk loans. In the original dataset, only 2.2% of loans are categorized as high risk. To get a truly accurate model, special techniques need to be used on imbalanced data. Undersampling is one of those techniques. Oversampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are other techniques that are also used.

## Preprocessing: Convert categorical data to numeric

Created a training set from the 2019 loans using `pd.get_dummies()` to convert the categorical data to numeric columns. Similarly, created a testing set from the 2020 loans, also using `pd.get_dummies()`. 

I created and fitted two models - Logistic Regression and Random Forests Classifier for scaled and unscaled data.

I've mentioned my observations and which model has performed better in the markdown of my jupyter notebook.
